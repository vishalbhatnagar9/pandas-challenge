## PyCity Schools Analysis

### Overview

The code analyzes school and student data, providing insights into school performance at the district and school levels. It covers district (schools within a district) and school (metrics within schools) summaries, performance by grade, spending, school size, and school type.

### District Summary

•	Total schools, students, and budget.

•	Average math and reading scores.

•	Percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall.

### School Summary

•	Breakdown of each school's metrics.

•	Includes school type, total students, budget, per student budget, average scores, and passing percentages.

### Top and Bottom Schools

•	Identifies highest and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing rates.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade

•	Average scores for 9th to 12th grades presented in separate DataFrames - namely "math_scores_by_grade" and "reading_scores_by_grade".

### Scores by Spending

•	Categorizes schools by spending per student.

•	Calculates average scores and passing percentages.

### Scores by School Size

•	Categorizes schools by size.

•	Calculates average scores and passing percentages.

### Scores by School Type

•	Groups schools by type (charter or district).

•	Calculates average scores and passing percentages.

### Conclusions

1. School Performance by type of school: It is noticed that Charter Schools have higher average scores in math and reading and higher passing rates in math, reading and overall as compared to District schools.

2. It is surprising to see that schools that have a lower per student budget, students tend to perform better than schools that have a higher per-student budget.
